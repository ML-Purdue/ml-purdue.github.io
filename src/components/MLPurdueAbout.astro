        ML@Purdue is Purdue University's premier student organization for
        machine learning and artificial intelligence. Founded in Fall 2010 and
        rebranded from ACM SIG AI in January 2023, we've built a thriving
        community where students explore, learn, and build at the cutting edge
        of AI/ML.
      </p>

      <p class="max-w-[75%] pl-8 text-sm">
        We support three pathways to success: Industry, Research, and
        Entrepreneurship. Whether you're aiming for a role at a top tech
        company, pursuing graduate research, or launching your own AI-powered
        venture, ML@Purdue provides the mentorship, hands-on experience, and
        community to help you get there.
      </p>

      <p class="max-w-[75%] pl-8 text-sm">
        Our members and alumni have gone on to work at organizations including
        Google, Amazon, Tesla, Apple, SpaceX, NASA, and Shield AI, as well as
        research labs like Purdue's CORAL Lab and Duality Lab. We are currently
        advised by Professor Culurciello, an expert in both professional use of
        machine learning and academia. Through collaborative projects, weekly
        reading groups that dive into cutting-edge research papers, hands-on
        workshops, and our flagship Catapult hackathon, we give students real
        opportunities to build skills that matter.
      </p>

      <p class="max-w-[75%] pl-8 text-sm">
        More than events and projects, ML@Purdue is a community. We connect you
        with mentors, collaborators, and opportunities that extend well beyond
        campus. Whether you're writing your first line of PyTorch or training
        models on Purdue's HPC clusters, there's a place for you here.
