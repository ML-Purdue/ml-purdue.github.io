            My name is Brian and I am interviewing Eugenio Culurciello.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Eugenio:</p><p>Nice to meet you, Brian.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Brian:</p><p>
            &nbsp;Thank you for this interview. Can you explain your background?
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Eugenio:</p><p>
            So I was actually trained on analog and mix signal chip, micro chip
            design. I worked in a neuromorphic engineering area at the
            beginning. So the idea was to figure out how to replicate human
            abilities in silicon or in artificial technologies. And then later I
            started working on machine learning and neural networks when I met
            Yann LeCune. I was at Yale university and he was at NYU. And then we
            met and we started working together. First, we started developing
            some micro chip accelerators for deep learning. That was like about
            15 years ago. Yeah, it&#39;s and yeah, this area was not really
            popular. And then, when I joined Purdue in 2011, I continued and my
            group developed about five generations of machine learning hardware,
            but we were also developing neural networks models and like my group
            has been also instrumental in like the beginning of by Torch, which
            was the precursor of PyTorch.
          </p>
          <p>
            So yeah, we work on all these areas. And right now, I&#39;m a
            professor at Purdue and I work on machine learning and AI, and I try
            to work on multimodal large model at the moment
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Brian:</p><p>
            I also saw that you taught some deep learning courses here
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Eugenio:</p><p>
            Absolutely. Yeah, actually, ours was the very first deep learning
            course at Purdue we started 2011, 12. And, it was the early days.
            And yes, we&#39;ve been teaching deep learning ever, ever since at
            least once a year.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Brian:</p><p>
            Yeah, I was actually interested in how come the deep learning
            courses were taught under BME instead of CS?
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Eugenio:</p><p>
            I was, yeah, I was I think under BME because a lot of our work was
            like taking inspiration from biology, neuroscience and psychology.
            And, but the final goal was like replicating the human brain in our
            own software. And when I when I joined here, there was a few people
            teaching neural networks basic fundamentals, but we were really the
            first class to teach the most more modern deep learning, including
            convolutional neural network and so forth.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Brian:</p><p>
            Okay, so I wanted to ask you about this, this paper I saw last year.
            It was called DishBrain and it&#39;s where researchers grew brain
            cells, and then they teach it to play the video game Pong. Because
            you have a lot of experience in hardware, I was wondering whether
            this is a plausible idea in the future, where you use real brain
            chips, and then these chips are specifically trained for certain
            tasks.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Eugenio:</p><p>
            I think it would be a good idea also because you know like currently
            all the machine learning, models that we built is highly inefficient
            compared to the brain, like on the order of 1000 to 10,000 times
            less efficient. And so like if you could interface to living and
            breathing live neural networks that would be awesome. One of the
            issues there is that we currently don&#39;t have the capability to
            really interface that a very large number of cells or high
            throughput. So the input and output is a bit limited. But that said,
            yeah, I think it could be very, very promising area if we can figure
            out a way to to grow the right number of electrode to interface with
            the tissue.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Brian:</p><p>
            Okay, so it might be hard to like add a like image sensor or
            something like directly to this brain shape, I guess
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Eugenio:</p><p>
            Yeah, I think that the problem is the number of, you know, in the
            brain, like maybe in a millimeter cube you have hundreds of
            thousands of cells right? But in terms of like a physical connection
            we couldn&#39;t have that many, right? There&#39;s probably a
            million of connection in there, but we can have the right, you know,
            the very large number of connection also, or all the connection that
            we have with from computers to biology like using some kind of
            electrical wires and they usually living cells don&#39;t usually
            like that that they reject that and that&#39;s also a problem for
            wearable technology that are invasive and it&#39;s it&#39;s always
            been a bit of a problem. I don&#39;t really know how to solve it at
            the moment, but yeah, there&#39;s many colleagues here who work in
            that area also.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Brian:</p><p>
            Okay. My next question. So, what do you think about the embodied
            Turing test, where instead of judging an AI based on how we can
            mimic human intelligence, you judge it based on how good it is at
            doing certain animal related tasks. For example, an artificial
            beaver building a realistic dam. And do you think this approach is
            more promising than current methods focus on focusing on like, you
            know, like linguistic simulation
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Eugenio:</p><p>
            Yeah, I honestly, you know, yeah, honestly, I agree with that like I
            really think that you know, we don&#39;t have a definition of
            necessarily what is this sort of an entity or what is another
            entity, you know, what is constitutes a cat and what is different
            from a dog or what really constitutes a human being, because
            there&#39;s so many levels there and we don&#39;t really have a
            formula for it. So I think that the best way for us to say whether
            artificial system is close to a real one is just, it&#39;s really
            what it can do. If you can do the same thing then functionally they
            might be equivalent. But you know, that also, you can&rsquo;t
            possibly test all possible things that one entity can do, because
            there are infinite possible combinations so you&#39;ll have to
            somehow there has to be some some kind of a test and I don&#39;t
            know what that is even, even recently with it is a large language
            model, you know, people are just started scratching the surface and
            they call possible there are no possible tests on these on these
            systems and try to figure out what capability they really have and
            they don&#39;t really have. And it&#39;s very unclear what what the
            results are what what you can do what you cannot do and at the end
            of the day you have to, it&#39;s a bit of a trial and error.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Brian:</p><p>
            &nbsp;Okay, like you just like that&#39;s like you just like keep
            coming up with some random tasks and you just see if it does well?
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Eugenio:</p><p>
            Yes, I mean, more than random tasks I guess. You know, it&#39;s
            always like this. You want artificial system is always to do
            something. So, I guess the idea is, you try to make it do what you
            want and try to make sure that it can can do more or less the thing,
            the same thing that a human can so for example, you know autonomous
            driving right? Even there you have an infinite number of scenario
            that that you could face the bite while driving a car right whether
            you&#39;re human or artificial. And so you can&#39;t possibly test
            all of them. You also can&#39;t possibly train on all of them. So
            you have to, yeah, you have to test on a lot of conditions and see
            what the problems are and design the system in a way that is fairly
            generic and he has a bit of common sense like us. Other than that,
            I&#39;m not sure if, if one could identify a test I will say okay
            yes this car is good enough to drive or not. I think we will never
            have such a test because it&#39;s there&#39;s always possible
            different conditions right? For example, years ago I was like
            driving on the road and all of a sudden I there was a ladder like
            blocking my entire lane.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Brian:</p><p>&nbsp;A ladder?</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Eugenio:</p><p>
            A ladder, yeah like a ladder that you walk on. And it was like
            pretty tall and I mean first of all you would have to recognize it
            and then you have to figure out what to do and my all the lanes
            nearby were like completely filled with cars and so I had to decide
            okay should I just break or should I go over it and if I go over it
            my prediction was okay all my tires are gonna pop. So you see my
            point my point is I run over it and nothing happened and the point
            is sometimes there&#39;s so many different possible cases. One time
            I was in Baltimore driving on the highway and some some some guy
            jumped off from the other lane and run through. I mean it was just
            all sorts of crazy things can happen on the road. I mean you could
            find a crater at some point a bridge that is interruppted you know
            it&#39;s all sorts of things so. So I don&#39;t think you test all
            these cases, right? So I&#39;m not sure that there is for for for
            leaving things that have infinite possible action if you infinite
            possible scenarios in the environment I don&#39;t think there will
            ever be a test that can test that all their capabilities honestly
            just by the sheer number of possibilities. You know it&#39;s the
            same for you right so when you go and take a driving test, what do
            they test? They test okay a little bit of your abilities. But
            it&#39;s just like a tiny subset you know 0.1 percent of what
            you&#39;ll ever encounter even normally. Yeah so and then they say
            yeah you&#39;re ready to drive. So I guess artificial system we
            usually hold them to a higher standards you know, where you&#39;re
            right. Which is you know good and bad but that&#39;s because we you
            know we kind of have an idea statistically what a human can do. You
            know, on the road and where you give him a driving license but we
            don&#39;t have a statistical idea what a machine can do so. The
            point is you have to test a lot and at some point you&#39;ll have
            the same kind of statistics and you&#39;ll be okay with that maybe.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Brian:</p><p>
            &nbsp;So I saw that you had a medium blog and you have lots of blog
            articles. So I read through some of them, and in one of your
            articles, you mentioned that transformers are really close to
            universal neural networks and can handle lots of different types of
            data such as vision, text, speech and so on. So do you think this is
            close to the final neural network architecture
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Eugenio:</p><p>
            Yeah I think so honestly like at the beginning at the beginning of
            your like let&#39;s say like 10, 15 years ago people were pretty
            happy by crafting neural networks and running it on some data and
            training it. But it was really hard to scale up and continue to
            learn different modalities and I think we spend way too much time
            focusing on creating data sets and creating custom neural networks
            for a specific data set. But at the same time people are looking for
            a swiss army knife of neural networks. And one such network could be
            the transformer architecture, which really surprised us you know
            honestly just in the last couple of years the capabilities that you
            know, all the data you can do and learn when scaled up even with
            these very simple learning techniques like predictive learning
            right? So I would say yeah that&#39;s like a really good. We&#39;re
            scratching the surface of it on what you know what the real
            artificial brain could be. I think we have to embody it and give it
            more senses and train multimodal and then try to figure out what can
            you learn, right? And we also need to figure out this continual
            learning capabilities now how much you can continue to learn and
            learn online. But I think it&#39;s, I would say now it&#39;s more
            exciting that five years ago. Five years ago it looked like we were
            doing the same things over and over and now it&#39;s, it looks like
            we have foundational models that can do much much more and so
            it&#39;s exciting. I hope, you know, I think by trial and error we
            will keep looking and try to find something that can model our
            brain. And that said we&#39;re still like 1000s of time away from
            terms of efficiency. The capabilities are getting better but also,
            you know, hasn&#39;t been really used in robotics as much and it
            hasn&#39;t really improved in the physical world. So I think
            there&#39;s still a lot of work to do. It&#39;s a never ending
            story. But it&#39;s exciting.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Brian:</p><p>
            Okay, so in another medium article that you wrote, you mentioned
            spiking neural networks, and those try to actually simulate the
            spiking in real neurons right and that seems like a step towards
            combining more neuroscience to AI. But at the same time, I know that
            those networks, they still rely on back propagation, which is not
            very neuroscience realistic. So in the future, do you expect that AI
            will continue to look almost one to one, like a real human brain to
            an AI, or do you think there will still be a combination of like
            engineering where you just just see whatever works?
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Eugenio:</p><p>
            Yeah, I think there&#39;s going to be a, you know, quite a few
            heuristics but you know the bottom line is that artificial system
            based on silicon are very different from biological neural network
            right? So biological neural network, which are great I mean they
            allow us to do all these things. But they have a fundamental problem
            which is that electricity doesn&#39;t conduct very well within our
            body right in a physiological solution. And so they only have, they
            can only transmit the pulses and over short channels I mean some
            channels are pretty long like from our brain all the way to the
            spinal cord is like a meter long right? But in general they use this
            spiking because the problem is you need to constantly reconstruct
            the signal that would dissipate otherwise. But in silicon we can
            make really good wires right, but in biology, you can have lots of
            wires in a very, very small area. In silicon we can&#39;t. We can
            only make like a few layers of wires and the density is very low. So
            things are different. But I think, and also there&#39;s much to
            learn because in, like in artificial neural network, &nbsp;you can
            do back propagation over many layers, you know, because you can look
            at the very small differences across many layers right in biology
            you know the noise is so high and you can only go from layer to
            layer. So, I think, you know, in artificial neural networks we still
            have to learn how to scale up the layer by layer learning. I
            don&#39;t know that might be more efficient. I&#39;m not sure. Maybe
            that&#39;s one of the ingredients of efficiency in the brain or
            maybe it&#39;s not. Maybe it turns out that artificial networks with
            back propagation are much more efficient or because you propagate
            the signal very, very, very easily and you can train them faster. I
            don&#39;t know if we know the answer to those questions. So
            we&#39;ll have to, we&#39;ll have to look at it and learn more and
            try things. I guess it is also we&#39;re stuck. Yeah, also like
            biology stuck with the the own substrate chemical biochemical
            substrate and we&#39;re stuck with the silicon chips right? Maybe
            there&#39;s another medium that would create better brains -
            artificial brains. But yeah, that&#39;s what we have right now. And
            so yeah, it&#39;s not, we can&rsquo;t answer those questions I guess
            right now, you know, people will still try to investigate these
            issues.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Brian:</p><p>
            So this interview is more oriented towards beginners, like in the
            club. I wanted to ask you, do you have any advice for students
            interested in AI?
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Eugenio:</p><p>
            Absolutely. Yeah. Well, I think it&#39;s, you know, honestly,
            it&#39;s a really great time today because of the internet and all
            the code and example and things that we can share. I think really
            what what a person needs is mostly drive. Like at any level, like if
            you think if you want to learn there&#39;s so much material but you,
            you shouldn&#39;t be discouraged and you have to figure out a way to
            learn step by step maybe by there&#39;s so many courses and so many
            levels in machine learning that I think you can, you know, anyone
            can can pick it up. And one of the issues of course also is need to
            learn programming a little bit. I would say you know, you start with
            the Python class or something like that and then you move on to some
            simple, simple class or simple tutorials on machine learning and
            then I think the next step is to jump into some nice project that
            you like. You see that this is a ML@Purdue group is really awesome
            because it allows you to form a group and learn from each other and
            do things together which keep you excited and motivated. So I think
            yeah, like if you&#39;re someone that already joined such a group or
            similar group anywhere and you have a passion you can learn really
            easily and you, honestly, you don&#39;t even, you don&#39;t need a
            university. You don&#39;t need a teacher you don&#39;t need a
            professor. A lot of the stuff you can go on your own which is nice
            and also scary and you just, you need a lot of passion, I think
            that&#39;s all. That&#39;s true for everything almost you know, but
            there&#39;s some things that it&#39;s hard to learn like I can&#39;t
            learn about nuclear power plant unless I work in one right? But
            machine learning, oh, gosh, just need a laptop. So it&#39;s so much
            easier
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Brian:</p><p>
            Yeah, I mean, just watching Youtube videos, I guess
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Eugenio:</p><p>
            &nbsp;Oh my god&nbsp;there&#39;s so much knowledge in there, right
            that you can learn from really awesome people and I do it too, you
            know, I often like listen to lectures and ideas online and people I
            never met and it&#39;s really awesome. Yeah, I mean it&#39;s just
            all you need is like some area that you&#39;re interested in and
            just to try to go deep deep solve all the problems more problems.
            There&#39;s always a problem to solve. And if you don&#39;t know you
            ask a group like even on GitHub there&#39;s there&#39;s amazing
            projects and you can join them and say what are the problems
            you&#39;re trying to solve and help them out. That&#39;s an awesome
            way to learn. And you can do that on your own on your laptop
            anywhere where you are so it&#39;s really great.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Brian:</p><p></p>
          <p>
            Yeah, I mean, on GitHub nowadays like everything that&#39;s trending
            is just some AI model or something
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Eugenio:</p><p>&nbsp;Yes</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Brian:</p><p></p>
          <p>
            Okay, my last question. So I know this, you might be a little
            biased, but do you think AI is just hype, like blockchain or like
            NFTs?
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Eugenio:</p><p>
            &nbsp;Yes. Well, AI is hype because I mean even you and I talk about
            AI now. I don&#39;t even like the term match because everything that
            we&#39;re doing so far is mostly machine learning. You know?
            It&#39;s like some basic learning algorithm. Maybe we&#39;re getting
            more into it now because we have this large foundational model, but
            I would say AI really starts when you have like a robot and
            you&#39;re trying to do something in the real world and constrained.
            And yeah, so I think we still need to do it. I think we don&#39;t
            know. I mean, definitely it would play a role but AI in the sense of
            machine learning neural net or deep learnings. But I think we need
            to do more work in robotics, you know, and because we&#39;re still
            behind so like even with all this algorithm, we don&#39;t have good
            algorithm to be able to grasp any kind of object or navigating an
            environment and there&#39;s still, we still don&#39;t know how to
            learn all these things. We still don&#39;t know how to learn
            multimodal integration in a robot that you have different sensors it
            keep learning and keep training and so I think that&#39;s an area
            that probably needs to evolve. But yes, if you know, if AI or what
            you want to call it now, it&#39;s going to empower this robot and I
            think it&#39;ll change the world for sure because we&#39;ll have
            like artificial entities that are, you know, as good or able as us
            or better. They could do lots of other things right there we cannot
            do. For example, we could send them to explore the universe because
            they live forever. They can live forever or they can replicate
            somewhere else. And maybe we won&#39;t even be able to know what
            they find out because our life is much so much shorter right and so
            much constrained by where we live in this planet and where we can
            reach in the short time we live
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Brian:</p><p>
            I was, when you were talking about robotics and AI, I was like
            thinking about those food robots around campus. We&rsquo;re going to
            see like 10 times more of that or something like we&#39;re just
            going to see some robots delivering like like I don&#39;t know
            refrigerator or something.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Eugenio:</p><p>
            &nbsp;No, that&#39;s right. Yeah, I mean those things cannot, you
            know, walk up the stairs or open the door and give things to you.
            But soon we will be able to do that. So that&#39;s great
          </p>
          <p>
            And I just hope that we&#39;ll be able to program them and make sure
            that they only work for a good cause.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Brian:</p><p>Thank you so much for the time</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="font-bold">Eugenio:</p><p>
            Okay, so it&#39;s been a pleasure to talk to you
          </p>
          <p>Yes, and you need anything</p>
          <p>Contact me again</p>
          <p>Okay, yeah</p>
