          <Item title="Time Series Forecasting for Air Pollution">
            In the Time Series forecasting for Air Quality/Pollution group, we
            are currently working on building an LSTM neural network model with
            the goal of predicting daily concentrations of PM10 (a pollution
            metric) in LA, California. We are also carrying out statistical
            analyses to contextualize why LA is highly polluted and come up with
            recommendations/policies to mitigate the effects of high pollution
            events. Project Manager: [Sameeha

          <Item title="Eye disease detection">
            We are attempting to create a dataset of eye diseases taken from in
            front of the eye (something that can be recreated easily with any
            modern phone) using GANS and then attempting to use a neural network
            to detect what disease is present in the eye. We are also attempting
            to do this using digital retinal scans. Project Manager: [Ivan
            Phillip](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-philip-51380b250/)

          <Item title="Chatbots">
            Learn how to prompt and sample from Large Language Models(LLMs) to
            create chatbots. Weâ€™ll be working with models such as GPT-3(the one
            that powers ChatGPT) and others. End goal of the project is to make
            a modular, customizable chatbot that can be plugged into any
            platform(Discord, Slack, a website, etc.) Project Manager: [Sagar

          <Item title="Lightning Wildfire Lab">
            As the climate changes and certain places are becoming more hot and
            less humid, we predict an increase in the risk of wildfire ignitions
            due to lightning. Our goal is to predict wildfire ignitions caused
            by lightning, as well as wildfire spreading and lightning striking
            patterns using neural networks driven by high-dimensional satellite
            data, and interpret the results using explainable AI techniques.
